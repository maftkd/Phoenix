this file is for documenting changes to script execution order
GameManager - this is first because many other scripts obtain references to game manager on awake.
Bird - unknown, maybe we should figure out if this is really neccessary
Cable - Cable needs to initialize and set up its points before puzzle box makes a call to fill the cable
MCamera - needs to get Camera before Intro can make calls to snap camera
